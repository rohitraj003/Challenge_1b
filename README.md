# Adobe Hackathon â€“ Connecting the Dots (Roundâ€¯1B)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This repository contains the solution for **Roundâ€¯1B: Persona-Driven Document Understanding** of the Adobe India Hackathon.  
It processes PDFs along with pre-generated outlines and ranks content sections based on a given **persona** and **job-to-be-done**.  
The solution runs fully offline, uses a local sentence-transformer model, and meets all hackathon constraints.

## ðŸ›  Approach  
* **PDF Parsing** â€“ Uses `pdfplumber` to extract text page-wise.  
* **Outline Integration** â€“ Reads outline JSON files (from Roundâ€¯1A) to identify sections; falls back to naive heading detection if no outline exists.  
* **Persona & Job Matching** â€“ Uses a locally stored **SentenceTransformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)** to compute semantic similarity between document sections and the persona/job description.  
* **Ranking** â€“ Scores and ranks sections by importance, selecting top-k relevant parts.  
* **Output** â€“ Produces a structured JSON with metadata, extracted sections, and subsection analysis.

## âœ… Results & Impact  
* **Contextual ranking** â†’ Highlights sections most relevant to a personaâ€™s needs.  
* **Offline-ready** â†’ Embedding model is stored locally, no internet or GPU required.  
* **Modular pipeline** â†’ Designed to integrate seamlessly with Roundâ€¯1A outputs.

## ðŸ–¥ Build & Run  

### 1. Build Docker Image
```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t round1b:somerandomidentifier .
```

### 2. Run Container
```bash
docker run --rm `
   -v "${PWD}\input3:/app/input:ro" `
   -v "${PWD}\input3_json:/app/input_json:ro" `
   -v "${PWD}\output3:/app/output:rw" `
   --network none `
   round1b:latest
```

**Input:**
- Place your PDFs in the `input/` directory.
- Place corresponding outline JSON files (from Roundâ€¯1A) in `input_json/`.
- Add `persona.txt` and `job.txt` in `input/` to customize ranking.

**Output:**
- Ranked and structured results will be saved as `round1b_output.json` in the `output/` directory.
